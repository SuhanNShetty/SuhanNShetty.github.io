I am a Ph.D. student at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)) and a research assistant at the [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en). I am doing my research at Robot Learning and Interaction group (RLI) under the supervision of [Dr.Sylvain Calinon](https://calinon.ch/).  


My research in robotics lies at the intersection of data-efficient machine learning and control engineering. In particular, using **low-rank tensor approximation techniques** I am developing algorithms for Robot Control, Reinforcement Learning, and Motion Planning that were previously considered to be intractable. 

If you are curious about my research, checkout my [previous work]((https://sites.google.com/view/ttgo/home)) which proposes a new methodology for global optimization of non-convex functions encountered in robotics. In my latest work, this is being used to develop optimal control techniques for robotic systems (including those having discontinuities arising from contact) which outperforms existing reinforcement learning algorithms for some commonly encountered tasks in robotics. 

## What is low-rank tensor approximation?
Low-rank tensor appoximation techniques (aka Tensor Networks in applied physics) are powerful function approximation techniques heavily used in physics computing including quantum computing. They are particularly interesting for robotics as they are highly interpretable and  allow efficient algebraic operations to be performed on them. Furthermore, they are much more efficient and accurate for many commonly encountered applications in robotics. See my publication list for details.
