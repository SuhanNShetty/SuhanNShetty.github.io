I am a Ph.D. student at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)) and a research assistant at the [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en). I am doing my research at Robot Learning and Interaction group (RLI) under the supervision of [Dr.Sylvain Calinon](https://calinon.ch/).  


My research in robotics lies at the intersection of data-efficient machine learning and control engineering. In particular, using **tensor approximation techniques** I am developing algorithms for Robot Control, Reinforcement Learning, and Motion Planning that were previously considered to be intractable. 

If you are curious about my research, checkout my [(previous work)]((https://sites.google.com/view/ttgo/home)) where I proposed a new methodology, called TTGO, for global optimization of non-convex functions encountered in robotics. It provides state-of-art results to solve some of the problems in robotics including inverse kinematics, motion planning and control, and it was applied in in projects Learn-Real and MEMMO.

My latest work is development of approximate dynamic programming algorithm,called TTPI, which provides a novel way to design controllers for highly nonlinear systems, including systems invloving hybrid states and actions. The approach beats state-of-art approximate dynamic programming and reinforcement learning algorithms for control synthesis for several benchmark control problems commonly encountered in robotics. This was developed under the Learn-Real project.

 In one of my previous works, I have also developed fast algorithms to find the Fourier series coefficients for higher dimensional functions which lead to a scalable ergodic exploration algorithm ([paper](https://sites.google.com/view/ergodic-exploration/)). This was applied in the project CoLLaboratE for industrial assembly tasks.

 Currently, I am trying to scale up well-known reinforcement learning algorithms that were previously considered to suffer from the curse of dimensionality.

## What is low-rank tensor approximation?

Low-rank tensor appoximation techniques (aka Tensor Networks in applied physics) are powerful function approximation techniques heavily used in physics computing including quantum computing. They are particularly interesting for robotics as they are highly interpretable and  allow efficient algebraic operations to be performed on them. Furthermore, they are much more efficient and accurate for many commonly encountered applications in robotics. See my publication list for details.
