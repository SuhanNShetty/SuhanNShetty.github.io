I am a Ph.D. student at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)) and a research assistant at Robot Learning and Interaction group (RLI) under the supervision of [Dr.Sylvain Calinon](https://calinon.ch/) in the [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en). Recently, I finished a research internship at [Disney Research Studios, Zurich](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/). Prior to my PhD I have worked in the Engineering Development Group at The MathWorks Inc. and as Research Associate in the Robert Bosch Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, Bangalore.


My research in robotics lies at the intersection of data-efficient machine learning and control engineering. In particular, using **tensor networks** I am developing algorithms for Robot Control, Reinforcement Learning, and Motion Planning that were previously considered to be intractable. 

If you are curious about my research, checkout my [previous work](https://sites.google.com/view/ttgo/home) which proposes a new methodology for global optimization of non-convex functions encountered in robotics. In my [latest work](https://sites.google.com/view/ttpi4control/home), this is being used to learn some highly challenging control tasks in robotics, outperforming existing reinforcement learning algorithms. 

## What are tensor networks?
 Tensor Networks (aka. low-rank tensor appoximation techniques) are powerful function approximation techniques heavily used in physics including quantum computing. They are particularly interesting for robotics as they offer interpretablity, algebraic manipulation and can model complex functions with high accuracy. See my publications for more details.
