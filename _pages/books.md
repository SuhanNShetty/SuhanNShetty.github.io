Here are some books I deeply recommend. During my Ph.D. studies, I went from reading barely one book per year, to read around 12 books over the last 9 months. You will find books from literary fiction, economics and even futuristic fiction!  

These are my personal picks. Feel free to recommend me a book throughout my personal email (juan.zuluaga@eu4m.eu)

Magic Realism
======
You might be wondering what is magic realism, well: also known as magical realism or marvelous realism, it is a 20th-century style of fiction and literary genre. The term was influenced by a German painting style of the 1920s given the same name. As a literary fiction style, magic realism paints a realistic view of the world while also adding magical elements, often dealing with the blurring of the lines between fantasy and reality. Magical realism, perhaps the most common term, often refers to literature in particular, with magical or supernatural phenomena presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane setting, commonly found in novels and dramatic performances. [More information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism).
